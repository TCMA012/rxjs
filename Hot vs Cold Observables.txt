Hot vs Cold Observables
https://benlesh.medium.com/hot-vs-cold-observables-f8094ed53339
a HOT observable when you donâ€™t want to create your producer over and over again

COLD is when your observable creates the producer
inside of the subscriber function
// COLD
var cold = new Observable((observer) => {
  var producer = new Producer();
  // have observer listen to producer here
});

HOT is when your observable closes over the producer
// HOT
var producer = new Producer();
var hot = new Observable((observer) => {
  // have observer listen to producer here
});



Observables are functions that tie an observer to a producer.



Cold Observables: Producers created *inside*




Hot Observables: Producers created *outside*

the operator `share()` makes a hot, refCounted observable that can be retried on failure, or repeated on success.
