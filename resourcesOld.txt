With RxJS v7.2.0, most operators have been moved to 'rxjs' export site. This means that the preferred way to import operators is from 
'rxjs', while 'rxjs/operators' export site has been deprecated.

there are two kinds of RxJS stuff: 
functions and operators. 
A function is imported from rxjs module.
Operators are functions too, nonetheless, their call must take place in a call of the 
pipe() method: a call of an RxJS operator is an argument of the method. 

? Operators are imported from the rxjs/operators module.
