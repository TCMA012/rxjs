always use | async pipes whenever you can, and let Observables handle the rest. 
And always keep your observables separated into two distinct types:

Pure observables, which take a value, maybe maps the value, and feeds into #2 or into an async pipe. These have NO side-effects

Side effect observables. You subscribe and unsubscribe to these. These perform side effects, like changing something when a query string changes.
